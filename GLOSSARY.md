## Callback
Code that's passed as an argument to other code and expected to call back, or execute at some time. In JavaScript, callbacks are often in the form of functions, and they're often asynchronous.

## Asynchronous
Used to describe actions that do not occur at  regular intervals. In the context of JavaScript, an asynchronous function or asynchronous block refers to code executing at a different time from everything else.

## Synchronous
Used to describe actions that occur at regular intervals. In the context of JavaScript and Ruby, synchronous code runs and finishes before moving on to the next task.

## TDD

## Namespace

## Closure
